# Computer-Vision-Object-Detection-with-OpenCV.
Developed a Python script for real-time object detection in videos using OpenCV and cvlib. The script efficiently processes video frames, integrates the YOLOv3-tiny model for accurate detection, and includes interactive controls for user convenience. 

<ul>
  
  <li>Developed a Python script in Google Colab to capture photos via webcam and predict age and gender using pre-trained deep learning models. Integrated Google Drive for model storage and utilized OpenCV for image processing.</li>
  <li>Technologies: Python, OpenCV, JavaScript snippet, Matplotlib, Google Colab, Google Drive.</li>
  <li>Integrated webcam functionality to capture images within a Google Colab environment using JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Mounted Google Drive to access and load pre-trained models for face detection, age, and gender prediction.</li>
  <li>Employed OpenCV's deep learning module (dnn) to process images and make predictions.</li>
  <li>Annotated detected faces with predicted age and gender and displayed the results using Matplotlib.</li>
  
</ul>
